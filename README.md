 Assignment: Pitching a Software Project
 Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of how to pitch a software project. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Understanding the Audience:
   - Why is it important to understand your audience when pitching a software project? How can you tailor your pitch to different types of stakeholders (e.g., investors, technical team, customers)?
  
Relevance and Resonance:
    A generic pitch might miss the mark. By tailoring your message to each audience, you highlight the aspects that resonate most with them. Investors care about market size and return       on investment, while a technical team focuses on functionality and architecture.
   
Credibility and Connection:
    Demonstrating an understanding of their priorities and challenges builds trust and establishes a connection. You appear more prepared and invested in their perspective.
